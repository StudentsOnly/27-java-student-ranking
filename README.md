## Exercise: Student Ranking Using TreeSet

#### Objective:

Practice using TreeSet to implement a student ranking system.

#### Description:

You are required to create a program that simulates a student ranking system using a TreeSet. The program should allow users to add student names and their scores, display the students ranked in descending order of scores, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a TreeSet to store student objects (each containing a name and score).
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Add student
    - Display student rankings
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To add a student, take input from the user for the student's name and score, and add it to the TreeSet.
- To display student rankings, iterate through the TreeSet in descending order of scores and print each student's name and score.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when adding students, scores, and handling menu options.
